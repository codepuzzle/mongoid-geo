- removed date field from gemspec

* Fixed major bug which stored coordinate in [:lat, :lng]. This is incorrect. Coordinates must be stored with :lng as the first value in order for geospatial queries to work properly.

- Excerpt from MongoDB GeoSpatial Indexing
'The code assumes that you are using decimal degrees in (longitude, latitude) order. This is the same order used for the GeoJSON spec. 
Using (latitude, longitude) will result in very incorrect results, but is often the ordering used elsewhere, so it is good to double-check.  
The names you assign to a location object (if using an object and not an array) are completely ignored, only the ordering is detected.'
